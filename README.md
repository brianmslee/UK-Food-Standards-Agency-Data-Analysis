- Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

- Which establishments in London have a rating value greater than or equal to 4?

- What are the top 5 establishments with a raing value of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

- How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
